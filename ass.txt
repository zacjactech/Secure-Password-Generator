Assignment: Password Generator + Secure Vault (MVP)

Tech stack: front end: next js (!imp)
database:Mongo
Backed: either next js or Node js (as per your suitability)

Also use typescript if favroble to write code!

Goal
Build a small web app where a user can:
Generate a strong password


Save it to a personal vault


View / edit / delete saved entries in a clean panel


Keep it fast, simple, and privacy-first.
Must-haves
Password generator (length slider, include numbers/letters/symbols, exclude look-alikes).


Simple auth (email + password).


Vault items: title, username, password, URL, notes.


Client-side encryption for vault items (you can pick the library), so server never stores plaintext.


Copy to clipboard with auto-clear.


Basic search/filter in the list.


Nice-to-have (optional)
2FA (TOTP)


Tags/folders


Dark mode


Export/import (encrypted file)


Constraints (light)
Any stack is fine. Prefer TypeScript if you’re comfortable.


Host anywhere free.


Keep UI minimal and fast (no heavy themes).


No secrets in logs.


Deliverables
Live demo URL


Repo link with README (how to run)


Short note: what you used for crypto and why (2–3 lines)


60–90 sec screen-record showing the flow (generate → save → search → edit → delete)


Acceptance (quick)
I can sign up, log in, add an item, and see only encrypted blobs in the DB/network.


Generator works and feels instant.


Copy clears itself after ~10–20s.


Basic search returns expected items.


Timebox
3–5 working days. Ship a rough version early; polish after.
